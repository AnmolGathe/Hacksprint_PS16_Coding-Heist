So, the code is divided into two phases, beginning with the first phase Execution will start from taking the password and id from host which will then be authenticated in the box named as “Password matched”. If the Authentication is successful then the user is authorized as host and if authentication fails then login page will display appropriate prompt.
 Further when host is authorized, a dashboard specially created for host will appear displaying Total Time played, Total users at that day and Total revenue of the day in report format. This dashboard will also be provided with buttons to logout and enlist pc of each active users, from where he can select a particular user and see time left, user number, revenue earned from each different individual.

Now when the First phase is fully Functional and operative, we would like to initiate phase 2 which is of adding user friendly dashboard.  The main motive of adding this dashboard for user is that he/she could set timer on its own. And as soon as game is in its course of an action, timer will start ticking.
When the time is about to end i.e., when the time remaining is 5 mins, a small popup will be shown that” u are about to exhaust the time provided” and a small timer counting in reverse will be provided.
When the time runs out, Bill will be displayed to the user and option to extend time will be provided.
